🚦 Traffic Accident Analysis Project

📌 Overview
This project is an end-to-end data analytics solution aimed at understanding traffic accident patterns and identifying key factors contributing to road accidents.
It integrates Python, SQL, and Power BI to clean, analyze, and visualize accident data for better decision-making and road safety insights.


🧰 Tools & Technologies

Python → Data cleaning & preprocessing

SQL (MySQL) → Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Power BI → Interactive dashboard visualization


🗂️ Project Workflow

Data Cleaning (Python):-

Handled missing and inconsistent data
Added necesarry columns
Standardized column names and data formats

Exploratory Data Analysis (SQL):-

Imported cleaned data into MySQL
Wrote SQL queries to explore key insights, such as:
Accidents by year and month
Injury type distribution
Top causes and crash types
Accidents by weather and roadway conditions


Visualization (Power BI):-

Built an interactive dashboard with the following visuals:
Accidents over time (trend by year/month)
Accidents by day of week and hour of day
Breakdown of accidents by injury type
Weather and surface condition analysis
Top causes and crash types
Peak risk hours and dangerous days


📊 Key Insights

Most accidents occurred during peak traffic hours (Evening time - 05:00 pm have the highest no. of accidents).

Turning points and Undivided roads have the highest no. of accidents indicating to take necessary actions .

Dry roads accounted for majority of accidents, indicating driver behavior as a key factor.

Weather and surface conditions influenced severity and frequency of crashes.
