🚦 Traffic Accident Analysis Project

📌 Overview
This project is an end-to-end data analytics solution aimed at understanding traffic accident patterns and identifying key factors contributing to road accidents.

It integrates Python, SQL, and Power BI to clean, analyze, and visualize accident data for better decision-making and road safety insights.


🧰 Tools & Technologies

Python → Data cleaning & preprocessing

SQL (MySQL) → Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Power BI → Interactive dashboard visualization


🗂️ Dataset Overview:-

• Name: Traffic Accidents Dataset

• Size: 2,09,307 rows

• Features: 24 columns

• Purpose: Used for analysis of accident patterns and trends





🗂️ Project Workflow

🧹 Data Cleaning (Python):-

Loaded raw dataset using Pandas

Handled missing and inconsistent data

Added necesarry columns

Standardized column names and data formats

Exported the cleaned dataset as a .csv file for SQL analysis



🧮 Exploratory Data Analysis (SQL)

Performed SQL queries to uncover insights, such as:

Total accidents per year/month

Accidents by day of week and hour of day

Injury type distribution

Top causes of accidents

Roadway and surface condition analysis

Weather impact on accident frequency





📊 Visualization (Power BI)

Built an interactive 3 pages dashboard with insights such as:

Accident trends by year & month

Accidents by day of week & hour of day

Breakdown by injury type

Accidents under different weather and surface conditions

Top causes and first crash types

Identification of peak risk hours and high-risk days

📈 Key Insights

Peak accident times occur during morning (7–9 AM) and evening (5–8 PM) rush hours.

Turning points and Undivided roads have the highest no. of accidents indicating to take necessary actions .

Dry roads accounted for majority of accidents, indicating driver behavior as a key factor.

Rainy and wet conditions showed a higher ratio of severe injuries.

Weather and surface conditions influenced severity and frequency of crashes.

✅ Actionable Recommendations

Based on the analysis:

Implement speed control measures (e.g., speed cameras) during peak hours.

Enhance road lighting and signage on accident-prone roadways.

Public awareness campaigns focusing on distracted and drunk driving.

Deploy more traffic enforcement units on weekends and peak hours.

Improve drainage and road maintenance to reduce wet-surface accidents.

Use these insights for policy formulation and urban traffic planning.
